# Predicting how a customer will feel about a product before they even ordered it

**Problem statement**: For a given customer's historical data, we are tasked to predict the review score for the next order or purchase. We will be using the [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). This dataset has information on 100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allow viewing charges from various dimensions: from order status, price, payment, freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally, reviews written by customers. The objective here is to predict the customer satisfaction score for a given order based on features like order status, price, payment, etc. In order to achieve this in a real-world scenario, we will be using [ZenML](https://zenml.io/) to build a production-ready pipeline to predict the customer satisfaction score for the next order or purchase.

The purpose is to understand the working of [ZenML](zenml.io) and in turn learning about MLOps in general. [ZenML](zenml.io) empowers your business to build and deploy machine learning pipelines in a multitude of ways:
- By offering you a framework and template to base your own work on.
- By integrating with tools like [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) for deployment, tracking and more
- By allowing you to build and deploy your machine learning pipelines easily
